      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Sodium vapor lamp emits primarily monochromatic yellow light.",
        "b": "Incorrect: 'Focusing' is not a nature of light but an optical effect.",
        "c": "Correct: The light is nearly monochromatic (single wavelength).",
        "d": "Incorrect: Composite light refers to mixture of wavelengths, unlike sodium vapor."
