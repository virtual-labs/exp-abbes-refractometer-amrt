    {
      "question": "Refractive index of the material increases when temperature",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increases",
        "b": "Decreases",
        "c": "Independent",
        "d": "First increases then decreases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "In most materials, as temperature increases, density decreases, hence refractive index typically decreases.",
        "b": "Correct: Generally, refractive index increases as temperature decreases due to increased density.",
        "c": "Refractive index does depend on temperature in most materials.",
        "d": "Rarely observed behavior in specific materials, not general case."

    {
      "question": "According to Total internal reflection,",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Light must travel from denser medium to rarer medium",
        "b": "Angle of incidence should be greater that of critical angle",
        "c": "Light must travel from rarer medium to denser medium",
        "d": "Both a and b"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: Total internal reflection occurs only when light moves from denser to rarer medium.",
        "b": "Correct: The angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle.",
        "c": "Incorrect: TIR cannot happen when moving to a denser medium.",
        "d": "Correct Answer: Both conditions are necessary for total internal reflection."

        "c": "Monochromatic",
        "d": "Composite light"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Sodium vapor lamp emits primarily monochromatic yellow light.",
        "b": "Incorrect: 'Focusing' is not a nature of light but an optical effect.",
        "c": "Correct: The light is nearly monochromatic (single wavelength).",
        "d": "Incorrect: Composite light refers to mixture of wavelengths, unlike sodium vapor."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Light travels faster in vacuum than in air.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Light travels slower in dense mediums like wood.",
        "c": "Correct: Speed of light is maximum in vacuum, about 3 x 10^8 m/s.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Slightly slower than in vacuum or air."
